Note! This repository is using a crufty old version of the visualizer
for embedding.

The reason for this is laziness, but specifically because there are
features of the Java Visualizer not yet supported on the main branch and
at pythontutor.com (as of the date of writing), in particular
command-line arguments and standard input.

As a result, this subdirectory has out-of-date copies from an old
version of the Python Tutor, which were then manually changed to be
Java-friendly. 

For reference, the files in this directry were taken from 
https://github.com/cemc/cscircles-wp-content
in the directory pybox/OnlinePythonTutor3-cemc
and then modified.
